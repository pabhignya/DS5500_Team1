# Harnessing Data Science for Northeasternâ€™s Instagram accounts

Understanding the tremendous power of social media platforms is critical in today's digital marketing landscape, helping both organisations and individuals. Instagram is a dominant player among these platforms, exerting enormous power in defining online visibility and engagement. The main goal of this project is to dive deeply into the subtle dynamics of Instagram reach and build a prediction model capable of anticipating the reach of future posts.

Our journey begins with a comprehensive exploratory study of the available data, followed by the development of an insightful Power BI dashboard to graphically portray reach data. This dataset contains critical information about content creators' posts and engagement metrics. We recognise the power of famous hashtags in increasing post reach, therefore we decided to look at how other post qualities, such as caption length, influence reach. To tackle these areas of study, we intend to build a specific machine learning model suited for time series reach forecasting, allowing precise predictions based on historical data and post attributes. We also intend to forecast the performance of future posts and rigorously assess the accuracy, errors, and potential biases inherent in our forecasts. This holistic strategy demonstrates our dedication to optimising Instagram's marketing potential and increasing online engagement.
