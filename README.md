# Harnessing Data Science for Northeastern’s Instagram accounts

Understanding the profound influence of social media platforms, particularly Instagram, is essential for modern digital marketing. Instagram wields significant power in shaping online visibility and engagement. This project's primary objective is to delve deep into the nuanced dynamics of Instagram reach and construct a predictive model capable of anticipating the reach of forthcoming posts.  

We are using a dataset from Statso which consists of 120 Instagram posts of the Statso founder’s Instagram account. Our primary objective is to analyze dynamics of Instagram reach and engagement for these posts. We aim to uncover the influential factors driving post reach, such as hashtags, caption characteristics, and the types of user engagement (saves, comments, shares, likes) and with this dataset, we strive to develop a time series forecasting model that can predict the reach of future posts with accuracy. As per our research, the impact of popular hashtags on post reach is high, we intend to investigate how other post attributes, such as caption length, likes and shares influence reach. To address these areas of investigation, we aim to conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the dataset, seeking patterns, correlations, and insights and then followed by the creation of a Power BI dashboard to visually present reach-related data. Later, develop a specialized machine learning model tailored for time series reach forecasting, enabling precise predictions based on historical data and post characteristics. Furthermore, we intend to forecast the performance of future posts and conduct a rigorous evaluation of the errors and potential biases inherent in our predictions. This comprehensive approach underscores our commitment to optimizing Instagram's marketing potential and enhancing online engagement while addressing specific dataset-related nuances.
